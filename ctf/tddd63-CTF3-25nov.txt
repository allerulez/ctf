This week we have made a score screen that displays at the end of a game instead of game crash.

Implemented functions: 
--Pause function, click 'p' to pause and 'u' to unpause.
--Spawn protection, when you die you gain a protective shield around you for 4 seconds.
--Score counter, it is visible at the left corner of the tank on the screen, 3 points for flag capture and 1 for a kill,
you also loose 2 points if you die from any source.
