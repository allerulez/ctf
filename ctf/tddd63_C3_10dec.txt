Group C3

This week we have done the following:
- Written a user manual, still needs to be updated since we've done more things after it was written
- We've made powerups that is symbolized as a question mark on the map, when you drive over it you get one of several power-ups (or power-downs).
- We've also implemented sound effects when a game starts, when a tank shoots and some background music
