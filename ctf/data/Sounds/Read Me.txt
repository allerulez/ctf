Because few peeps that have heard some of my sounds i went ahead and made a pack. All the radio wavs execpt for the terwin and ctwin i made myself. Along with opera,arabstreets, and afew of the pain/death wavs i did. Arabstreets is not yet finished but i threw it in here anyways. Anyways enjoy and if i get enough postive response from this pack lol i will make another one with my other sounds when completed.
